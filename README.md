# ISI-B.Math-Sem -IV
Here you can get access to the study materials and assignmnets (with solution) of all the courses provided to B.Math Second Year Students (Sem -IV) on the year 2023. In general, five courses are offered in each semester. The courses offered this semester are listed below. Question paper of corresponding subjects of Midsem and Semestral exams can be found in the [official webpageof ISI](https://www.isibang.ac.in/~adean/infsys/database).

### Electrodynamics ###
  * This Course was instructed by [Dr. Prabuddha Chakraborty](https://www.isibang.ac.in/~adean/infsys/database/Bmath/Ele.html/ "Dr. Prabuddha Chakraborty"). The text books, required refferences and assignments along with their solutions (some solution are provided rest solution are not provided because their submission were in offline mode) are provided in this [link](https://github.com/Trishan8/ISI-B.Math-Sem--III/tree/main/Electrodynamics).

### Diffrential Equation ###

This course was instructed by [Prof. CRE Raja](https://www.isibang.ac.in/~creraja/) and [Vivek Agrahari](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vivek-kumar-agrahari-3253bba6/?trk=people-guest_people_search-card&originalSubdomain=in). All the study material and assignments used in this course can be found [here](https://github.com/Trishan8/ISI-B.Math-Sem-IV/tree/main/Ordinary%20Differential%20equation). (The submissions were offline so there is no softcopy of the solutions).

### Rings and Modules ###  
  * This course was instructed by [Prof. B.Sury](https://www.isibang.ac.in/~sury/). During this course we mostly followed [Introduction to Rings and Modules - C.Musili](https://libgen.rs/book/index.php?md5=FFF8CA8E2C8ADF55A09FF626B255E4BC) and <em> Abstract algebra </em> by [Dummit and Foote](https://dokumen.tips/documents/dummit-and-foote-abstract-algebra-third-edition.html). We got very nice assignments during the course. Find all the assignmnets and their solution in this [link](https://github.com/Trishan8/ISI-B.Math-Sem--III/blob/main/Rings%20and%20Modules)
  
    * During the course we got many references from the professor and they are written [here](https://github.com/Trishan8/ISI-B.Math-Sem--III/blob/main/Rings%20and%20Modules/Concise%20Lecture%20Notes%20(Incomplete).pdf). This note is incomplete. If anyone is interested to finsh it up, please contact me.


### Introduction to Linear Models and Regression ##
 * This course was instructed by [prof. Mohan Delampady](https://www.isibang.ac.in/~mohan/). The refferences and professor's note can be found in this [link](https://github.com/Trishan8/ISI-B.Math-Sem-IV/tree/main/Introduction%20to%20Linear%20Models%20and%20Regression).

### Topology ###

* This course was instructed by [Prof. Maneesh Thakur](https://isi.irins.org/profile/122628). During the course we mostly followed <em> Introduction to topology and modern analysis </em> by [G.F.Simmons](https://www.academia.edu/41477596/_Simmons_Introduction_to_Topology_and_Modern_Analysis) and <em> Topology </em> by [J.Munkres](http://mathcenter.spb.ru/nikaan/2019/topology/4.pdf). All the assignments in this course and their solution can be found [here](https://github.com/Trishan8/ISI-B.Math-Sem-IV/tree/main/Topology). 


  * This course was mainly for point set topology but oure professor covered some interesting topics like Topological groups, Classification of surfaces. For these the text refences were, <em> A Basic course in algebraic topology </em> by [W.S.Massey](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4939-9063-4) and <em> Basic Topology </em> by [Armstrong](https://libgen.rs/book/index.php?md5=8B995F78BB1E7FA0B53CA57F21FD5003).
 
  * This [Homework](https://github.com/Trishan8/ISI-B.Math-Sem-IV/blob/main/Topology/Topo-homework-2(Printed).pdf) is very special. While solving these problems we came across p-adic topology and compact-open topology.
